# MFlix User Management Application

## Overview

Welcome to the MFlix User Management Application! This is a full-stack application that allows users to manage their profiles by fetching names from a MongoDB cluster. It features two main components: a User Form for inputting user details and a User List for displaying those details.

**Please Note:** This application is currently a work in progress. There are known issues that need to be addressed, including incomplete functionality for user updates and a lack of styling.

## Features

- Fetch user data from a MongoDB cluster.
- User Form component for adding and updating user information (name and email).
- User List component for displaying all users.
- Edit and delete functionality for user profiles.

## Current Status

- The **User Update** feature is not fully functional yet.
- The application lacks adequate styling, making the user interface less visually appealing.
  
Contributors are encouraged to help work on these areas for improvement!

## Backend
The backend for this application is hosted on Render. You can find the backend code repository on GitHub here: https://github.com/Jenkos23/FullStackMern-App-Project.git
# Deployed : Url: https://fullstackmern-app-project.onrender.com
# endpoints: 
1. Users: Url/users
2. individual user by Id: Url/users/_id
 

## Application Structure

### Components

1. **User Form**:
   - Built to collect user details (name and email).
   - Allows users to add new profiles or update existing ones (needs functionality completed).

2. **User List**:
   - Displays a list of users retrieved from the MongoDB database.
   - Each user can be edited or deleted.

### Service

- **apiService.jsx**:
  - Located in the `service` directory, this file contains all the API endpoints required to interact with the backend.
  - This service layer abstracts the HTTP requests for cleaner component code and easier maintenance.

### Entry Point

- **App.jsx**:
  - The main entry point of the application.
  - Responsible for rendering the User List to the browser and managing the overall application flow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
